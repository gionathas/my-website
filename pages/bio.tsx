        My career as a <strong>Software Developer</strong> started back then
        when i began studying CS at the University of Pisa.
        <br /> <br />
        After completing the studies I started working as a{' '}
        <strong>Java Backend Developer</strong> for an italian company, where I
        was involved in different kind of projects: from pure enterprise
        applications development to IoT infrastructures. <br /> <br />
        It was a great first experience, lasted for more than 3 years, in which
        I grew both as a software engineer and as a person. <br />
        <br />
        At some point i began realizing that i wanted something different for my
        career. I wanted to set out on my own and see what I could achieve with
        my skills alone. <br /> <br />
        So i decided to left my daily job and started to learn new tech skills
        mainly related to Web development. <br /> <br />
        While studying some fancy new stuff i&apos;ve also started building my
        own projects and showcasing the results on Youtube, to both share my
        experiences and to take the opportunity to teach what i&apos;ve learned.
        <br /> <br />
        Currently i&apos;m working as a freelancer, but i&apos;m open for new
        exciting job opportunities that could come in the future. <br /> <br />
