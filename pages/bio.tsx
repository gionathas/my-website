        My career as a <strong>Software Developer</strong> started back when i
        began to study Computer Science at the University of Pisa 🇮🇹
        <br /> <br />
        After i finished my studies, i started working as a{' '}
        <strong>Java Backend Developer</strong> for an Italian Company 🇮🇹, where
        i worked in different kind of projects: from pure Enterprise
        Applications to <strong>IoT</strong> Applications 📍. <br />
        Back then my tech stack was mostly based on Java and Spring Boot ♨️ (for
        the development phase), while for the deployment phase we used Docker
        and Kubernetes 🐳 <br /> <br />
        It was a nice experience, it helped me a lot to grow as a SWE and to
        taste what it means to work in the world of Software Development. <br />
        <br />
        At some point i started realizing that i wanted something different for
        my career, i wanted to set out on my own and see what I could achieve
        with my skills alone 🚶🏻 <br />
        So i decided to left my daily job and started to learn new tech skills
        related to the Web development 🌐. <br /> <br />
        I started learning React, Javascript, Typescript, NodeJS etc.. and began
        to build my own projects 🔨. This gave me the opportunity to be able to
        express my creativity under the form of digital services that everyone
        could use. <br /> <br />
        Now i work as a freelancer, but i&apos;m also open for new exciting
        opportunities that can come. <br /> <br />
